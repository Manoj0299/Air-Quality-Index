# Air-Quality-Index

**Problem Statement:**
Air quality for a human being and all the living species is a vital part of life. Variation of
air quality creates a high impact on human life; continuous monitoring and evaluation
and investigation of AIR quality are critical. Based on that, we are supposed to take and
action and control all the activities in every sense.

**Approach**
The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.

**About Dataset**
We are going to do the air quality index prediction using Machine Learning . The Data is taken from the webpage https://en.tutiempo.net/climate/ws-432790.html
Air Quality is now a big problem faced is many cities around the world. The Quality of the air is measured using the Temperature , Oxygen levels, Humidity, Rain or snow precipitation, Visibility and Wind speed.

**To Be Noted**
1. Data is not Normally Distributed in this Dataset.For that purpose the Transformation Method is used.
  Transforms are usually applied so that the data appear to more closely meet the assumptions of a statistical inference procedure that is to be applied, or to improve     the interpretability or appearance of graphs. Nearly always, the function that is used to transform the data is invertible, and generally is continuous.

  1. Logarithmic Transformation 
  2. Reciprocal Transformation 
  3. Square Root Transformation 
  4. Exponential Transformation 
  5. 5. Boxcox Transformation 

2. Standard Scaler also Used.
3. Feature Selection
4. Cross-Validation also used and tried different Regression Algorithms which is best fit for this data by comparing accuracy score.
